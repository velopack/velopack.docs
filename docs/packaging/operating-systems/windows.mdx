# Windows Overview
<AppliesTo win />
Windows specific notes about creating and using Velopack packages.

For Windows, Velopack creates and installs a folder structure which looks like the following:

```
%LocalAppData%
└── {packId}
    ├── current
    │   ├── YourFile.dll
    │   ├── sq.version
    │   └── YourApp.exe
    └── Update.exe
```

## Packaging
There are no special requirements to package a program for Windows, although you may wish to customise the installer 
using `--packTitle`, `--splashImage`, `--icon` etc. See the command line help for a complete list of options.

It's also very recommended (but not required) that you [code sign](../signing.mdx) before shipping to your users. If you do not do this,
your app may be flagged as a virus.

## Updating
During updates, the entire `current` directory will be replaced, so if you need to store settings, logs, crash reports, and so on, 
please see [Preserving Files](../../integrating/preserved-files.mdx).

On Windows, if any of the files inside `current` are in-use, the folder can not be moved/renamed/deleted, etc. 
There are lots of things that could lock this folder. For example:
- A process running inside `current`
- A process running outside of `current`, which has opened a file inside `current` for reading. 
- Anti-virus / Windows Defender, etc
- A process with it's CWD (current working dir) inside that folder (for example, a `cmd.exe` process).

If the folder can not be renamed during the update process, Velopack's updater will attempt to automatically kill any processes running inside `current`.
If the folder is still locked and can not be renamed, the updater will search for other processes on the system which may be locking the folder - 
and if any are found, it will open a dialog to the user offering to kill them or abort the update. If the locking process could not be identified,
(for example, if the locking process is running as Administrator) then an error message will be shown to the user, and the old version of the
application will be launched.

:::info
Currently, neither the updater nor the installer support privileged directories such as `C:\Program Files`, but support for this is planned in the future.

## Installing
The setup produced by Velopack is a one-click installer, which will show the splash image of your choice (PNG, JPG, or animated GIF), 
or if you do not provide an image it will be a simple progress bar. 

By default the installer will install to `%LocalAppData%\{packId}` but this can be overridden at runtime with the `Setup.exe --installto {dir}` argument.

Before starting installation, the installer will check that the [App Runtime](../runtime.mdx) is compatible with the current operating system,
and also check for any missing [bootstrapping dependencies](../bootstrapping.mdx).

Also, during installation the installer will run [App Hooks](../../integrating/hooks.mdx), as well as launch the application for the first time 
once installation has completed. If you would like to prevent the application from being launched after install has completed,
you can do this with the `Setup.exe --silent` argument.
