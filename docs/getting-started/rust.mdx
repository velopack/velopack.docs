## Quick Start
1. Add Velopack to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
velopack = { version = "0.0", features = ["async"] } # Replace with actual version and desired features
```

2. Add the following code to your `main()` function:
```rust
use velopack::*;

fn main() {
// VelopackApp should be the first thing to run, in some circumstances it may terminate/restart the process to perform tasks.
VelopackApp::build().run();
// Your other app startup code here
}
```

3. Add auto-updates somewhere to your app:
```rust
use velopack::*;

fn update_my_app() {
let source = sources::HttpSource::new("https://the.place/you-host/updates");
let um = UpdateManager::new(source, None, None).unwrap();

if let UpdateCheck::UpdateAvailable(updates) = um.check_for_updates().unwrap() {
// there was an update available. Download it.
um.download_updates(&updates, None).unwrap();

// download completed, let's restart and update
um.apply_updates_and_restart(&updates).unwrap();
}
}
```

4. Build your app with cargo:
```sh
cargo build --release
```

5. Install the `vpk` command line tool:
```sh
dotnet tool update -g vpk
```
***Note: you must have the .NET Core SDK 8 installed to use and update `vpk`***

6. Package your Velopack release / installers:
```sh
vpk pack -u MyAppUniqueId -v 1.0.0 -p /target/release -e myexename.exe
```

âœ… You're Done! Your app now has auto-updates and an installer.
You can upload your release to your website, or use the `vpk upload` command to publish it to the destination of your choice.
