# Getting Started: C / C++

<AppliesTo all />
Get started with our cross-platform C / C++ library.

The Velopack C / C++ library is a pre-compiled dynamic library, which you can link into your application to enable auto-updates and installers.
There is a C and a C++ API available in [Velopack.h](https://github.com/velopack/velopack/blob/develop/src/lib-cpp/include/Velopack.h),
so this library is suitable for C / C++ application as well as other programming languages which support calling C functions eg. p/invoke. 

:::tip
All the strings (eg. `char*` or `std::string`) are expected to be UTF-8 encoded. 
On Windows, you may need to convert `wchar_t*` and `std::wstring` to UTF-8 before passing it to the library.
:::

<FancyStep step={1}>
    Download the latest `velopack_libc_{version}.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/velopack/velopack/releases) and include it into your project.
    Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory you can reference in your project.
</FancyStep>

<FancyStep step={2}>
    Add the `include` directory from the extracted content to your include path, and add the appropriate binary from `lib` to your linker options.
    You will find both a `lib` and `lib-static` directories in the extracted contents.
</FancyStep>


<FancyStep step={3}>
    Add `VelopackApp` to your entry point (eg. `main()` or `wmain()`) as early as possible, ideally the first statement to run:
    ```cpp
    #include "Velopack.h"

    wmain(int argc**, wchar_t *argv[ ], wchar_t *envp[ ])
    {
        // This should run as early as possible in the main method.
        // Velopack may exit / restart the app at this point. 
        // See VelopackApp class for more options/configuration.
        Velopack::VelopackApp::Build().Run();

        // ... your other startup code here
    }
    ```
</FancyStep>

<FancyStep step={4}>
    Velopack provides a simple way to check for updates and apply them. 
    The following show how to implement a basic update check within your application. 
    
    You can also split up the various methods to allow your users to control when to check for updates, download them, or apply them.

    ```cpp
    #include "Velopack.h"

    static void update_app()
    {
        // This will default to using Velopack Flow as the IUpdateSource
        Velopack::UpdateManager manager();

        auto updInfo = manager.CheckForUpdates();
        if (!updInfo.has_value()) {
            return; // no updates available
        }

        // download the update, optionally providing progress callbacks
        manager.DownloadUpdates(updInfo.value());

        // prepare the Updater in a new process, and wait 60 seconds for this process to exit
        manager.WaitExitThenApplyUpdate(updInfo.value());
        exit(0); // exit the app to apply the update
    }
    ```
</FancyStep>

<FancyStep step={5}>
    Compile your app to a program using your usual compiler (eg. msvc, cmake, gcc, etc)
    Make a note of the the output directory, as you will need it to package your app.
