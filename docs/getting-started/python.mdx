# Getting Started: Python
<AppliesTo all />
Get started with our python library.

<FancyStep step={1}>
    Install velopack from the Python Package Index:
    ```txt
    pip install velopack
    ```
</FancyStep>

<FancyStep step={2}>
    Add the following code to your entry point (eg. `main.py`) as early as possible (before any electron startup code etc.):
    ```python
    import velopack

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Velopack builder needs to be the first thing to run in the main process.
        # In some cases, it might quit/restart the process to perform tasks.
        velopack.App().run()

        # ... your other app startup code here
    ```
</FancyStep>

<FancyStep step={3}>
    Velopack provides a simple way to check for updates and apply them. 
    The following shows how to implement a basic update check within your application. 
    
    You can also split up the various methods to allow your users to control when to check for updates, download them, or apply them.

    ```python
    def update_app():
        # This will default to using Velopack Flow as the IUpdateSource
        manager = velopack.UpdateManager()

        update_info = manager.check_for_updates()
        if not update_info:
            return # no updates available

        # Download the updates, optionally providing progress callbacks
        manager.download_updates(update_info)

        # Apply the update and restart the app
        manager.apply_updates_and_restart(update_info)
    ```
</FancyStep>

<FancyStep step={4}>
    Compile your app to a binary (eg. `.exe` on Windows). Example using PyInstaller:
    ```sh
    pyinstaller --onedir app.py
    ```
</FancyStep>
