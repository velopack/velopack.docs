            <strong>Configure Velopack at the beginning of your entry point</strong>
        </summary>

        Add the following code to your entry point (eg. `main.py`) as early as possible (before any electron startup code etc.):
        ```python
        import velopack

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            # Velopack builder needs to be the first thing to run in the main process.
            # In some cases, it might quit/restart the process to perform tasks.
            velopack.App().run()

            # ... your other app startup code here
        ```

            <strong>Add update check within your app</strong>
        </summary>

        Velopack provides a simple way to check for updates and apply them. 
        The following shows how to implement a basic update check within your application. 
        
        You can also split up the various methods to allow your users to control when to check for updates, download them, or apply them.

        ```python
        def update_app():
            manager = velopack.UpdateManager("https://the.place/you-host/updates")

            update_info = manager.check_for_updates()
            if not update_info:
                return # no updates available

            # Download the updates, optionally providing progress callbacks
            manager.download_updates(update_info)

            # Apply the update and restart the app
            manager.apply_updates_and_restart(update_info)
        ```

            <strong>Build your app</strong>
        </summary>

        Compile your app to a binary (eg. `.exe` on Windows). Example using PyInstaller:
        ```sh
        pyinstaller --onedir app.py
        ```
