# Velopack Flow
<AppliesTo all />

<FlowLink text="Flow" /> is Velopack's hosted solution for distributing applications. It provides a seamless way to distribute your Velopack applications. If you would prefer to self-host your application and manually manage update and rollbacks, see the [self-hosting](self-hosting.mdx) section.

## Features

- Full Managed Solution No need to manage your own infrastructure.
- [Tiered Rollouts](Flow/tiered-rollout.mdx): Gradually release updates to a subset of users before a full rollout.
- [Static Links](Flow/static-links.mdx): Static links that can be used to direct users to the latest release of your application, or a specific release.
- [API](Flow/api.mdx): A REST API that allows you to programmatically manage your releases, channels, and projects.

## Getting Started

### Integrating with Flow
Simply following current [integration guide](../integrating/overview.mdx) to integrate Velopack into your application. Make sure the [UpdateManager](../reference/cs/Velopack/UpdateManager) is configured to use the [VelopackFlowSource](../reference/cs/Velopack/Sources/VelopackFlowSource) as the [IUpdateSource](../reference/cs/Velopack/Sources/IUpdateSource). This is the default behavior of the default constructor.

### Publishing to Flow
Start by creating a free account on <FlowLink />.

Once you have an account, you need to create a project. This can be done by click the "Create New Project" button on the main dashboard, or by navigating to the Projects list on your Team's home page.
Make sure that the Package Id you enter exactly matches the `--packId` you used when building your Velopack release. 

Back in the Velopack CLI, package your application as you normally would following the [packaging guide](../packaging/overview.mdx). 

Next login to the Flow service by running the following command.
```bash
vpk login
```
For more details on authenticating with Flow through the `vpk` CLI see [Flow Authentication](Flow/authentication.mdx).

You can now upload your release to Flow by running the following command in the directory where your release is located:
```bash
vpk publish --outputDir <OutputDir> --channel <Channel>
```

Done! You can now view the release in Flow. Within a few minutes the release will be available and ready for distrobution.
