# Release Notes
<AppliesTo all />
It is possible to store release notes (Markdown) in update packages and access it while Updating. This could be useful, for example, to show a user a list of changes before downloading a update.

- Write your release notes to a file (eg. releasenotes.mdx).
- While packing your release, provide these to Velopack with `--releaseNotes {path/to/releasenotes.md}`

The Velopack builder will render this to HTML for your convenience, and store both the HTML and the markdown into your update package.

Now, release notes will be available while checking for updates, for example:

```cs
private static async Task UpdateMyApp()
{
    // This will default to using Velopack Flow as the IUpdateSource
    var mgr = new UpdateManager();

    var newVersion = await mgr.CheckForUpdatesAsync();
    if (newVersion != null) {
        var releaseNotesHtml = newVersion.TargetFullRelease.ReleaseNotesHtml;
        // show a window here with the release notes
        // possibly ask the user if they wish to update or not?
        // eg. new ReleaseNotesHtmlWindow(releaseNotesHtml).Show();
    }
}
```
