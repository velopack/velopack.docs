# Windows Shortcuts
<AppliesTo win />
By default, during installation Velopack will create a shortcut on the Desktop and in the StartMenuRoot. It will automatically delete any shortcuts it finds when uninstalling the application.

The name of the shortcuts will be determined by the `--packTitle` vpk argument. For example, if you pass `--packTitle "My Fancy App"`, then the shortcuts created will be created as `"My Fancy App.lnk"`.

You can specify where you'd like shortcuts to be created by using the `--shortcuts {locations}` command line argument. The following locations are supported:
- `Desktop`
- `StartMenuRoot`
- `StartMenu` (this is a subfolder in the StartMenuRoot, must also specify `--packAuthors`)
- `Startup`
- `None` (to disable shortcut creation)

If you wanted to install into start menu and desktop, the argument you'd need is `--shortcuts Desktop,StartMenuRoot`.

### Legacy Shortcuts

If you need to create shortcuts in any extra locations, the `Velopack.Windows.Shortcuts` and `Velopack.Windows.ShellLink` classes are provided. 
These classes are provided for legacy reasons, and in general the stability of such functions is not guarenteed.

For example, if you wished to create a shortcut during the install of your app, you might do the following:

```cs
using Velopack;
using Velopack.Windows;

VelopackApp.Build()
    .WithAfterInstallFastCallback((v) => new Shortcuts().CreateShortcutForThisExe(ShortcutLocation.Desktop))
    .Run()
```
